\f0\fs24 \cf0 This project is built off Intel\'92s Deep learning 101 online course free to access at: (https://intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/artificial-intelligence/training/course-deep-learning.html). I will delineate what is my work and what was provided with the course. The three parts of the this project are Intel understanding, creating the basis on python for the deep learning and then using verilog to develop to test training and running a pre-trained model on FPGA hardware. }
