\f0\fs24 \cf0 With the basics of deep learning, in this folder there are 2 main things that will be made, a CNN for computer vision recognition, and then a neural network for looking at financial data and seeing if any growth extrapolation can be made with that data. Once these NN are made and trained I will use their weights to make neural networks in verilog for a FPGA to test speed, power requirement, and cost differences for both systems off my computer and on the FPGA. Any online resources that will be used will be documented here.}
